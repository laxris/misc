I used to not have my own repositories on github---mostly because I did not want to put more unmaintained code out there. A lot of things tend to break or at least need some updating over time, as the build tools, APIs, or underlying frameworks evolve.

This repo just serves to show that I can write code and know how to use standard development tools.
